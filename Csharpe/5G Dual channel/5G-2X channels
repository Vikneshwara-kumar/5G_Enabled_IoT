### The below code and comments will help us out to configure a Dual channel communication over 5G.

> To use network bonding in Ubuntu or Debian-based Linux systems, we must first install the bonding kernel module and use the command modprobe to see if the bonding driver is loaded or not.

```
sudo modprobe bonding
```

> If you have an older version of Debian or Ubuntu then we should install ifenslave package. With the below command.

```
sudo apt-get install ifenslave
```

> Run the below command to access the GUI

```
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

In the GUI copy paste the below command and save it. Then exit it.

### The primary network interfaces
```
auto bond0
iface bond0 inet static
	address 192.168.241.50
	netmask 255.255.255.248
		slaves wwan0 wwan1
		bond_mode 0
		bond-miimon 100
		bond_downdelay 200
		bond_updelay 200
```
    
Different mode as different functionality. Select the mode depending on your requirement.
*	mode=0 (balance-rr)
*	mode=1 (active backup)
*	mode=2 (balance-xor)
*	mode=3 (broadcast)
*	mode=4 (802.3ad)
*	mode=5 (balance-tlb)
*	mode=6 (balance-alb)

> Now restart the network services or reboot the system (rebooting the system is recommended)

```
sudo systemctl restart networking.service
```

> Run the below command to check and verify the bonding interface

```
ifconfig 
```

> Now install nload which is used to monitor the network functionality.

```
sudo apt install nload
```

> This below command will open the monitoring page for wwan0

```
nload wwan0
```

> This below command will open the monitoring page for wwan1

```
nload wwan1
```
