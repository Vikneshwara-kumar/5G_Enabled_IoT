# 5G for Industrial Internet of Things

The future of industrial production lies in Industry 4.0, the intelligent factory, and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). A suitable framework for communication and thorough connectivity are needed to increase the flexibility, autonomy, and efficiency of production facilities and intralogistics. The development of 5G communication standard offers significant new perspectives. In the project 5G communication standard is used to implement and investigate a industrial use case.

The main focus of this project  is divided into following parts 
1) To monitor and control server systems over 5G network using OPC UA protocol 
2) Testing the latency over a long range.
3) PoC for dual channel in a 5G moderm for redundancy in network.
